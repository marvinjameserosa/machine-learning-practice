# Machine Learning Practice
This repository showcases my foundational knowledge in machine learning concepts, based from the Machine Learning series by TechWithTim. It serves as my requirement for aspiring members of the PUP Hygears Programming Team, demonstrating my ability to apply theoretical knowledge to practical implementations.
